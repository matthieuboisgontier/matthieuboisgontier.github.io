    I am a neuroscientist, a kinesiologist, and a physiotherapist.
    I am passionnate about physical activity, and how the brain works 
    but am always open to work on other topics. 
    My main objectives are to to do open, robust, and replicable science, to collaborate with clever researchers who are also good people, and to support open-science practices.
