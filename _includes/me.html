    I am a neuroscientist, a kinesiologist, and a physiotherapist. My MSc focused on the impact of muscle fatigue and sensory 
    supplementation on proprioception and postural control. During my PhD, I investigated the central mechanisms 
    underlying age-related decline in proprioception on the Techniques for Biomedical Engineering and Complexity 
    Management – Informatics, Mathematics and Applications Grenoble <a href="http://www-timc.imag.fr/?lang=en">(TIMC–IMAG)</a> team that is embedded in the 
    French National Center for Scientific Research <a href="http://www.cnrs.fr/index.html">(CNRS)</a> and <a href="https://www.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/en/">Universite Grenoble – Alpes</a>, France. As a postdoc at <a href="https://www.kuleuven.be/english/">KU Leuven </a>, Belgium, I explored the brain predictors of postural instability/falls, 
    action selection, and bimanual coordination. At the University of British Columbia <a href="https://www.ubc.ca/">(UBC)</a>, Canada, I investigate our automatic attraction to energetic cost minimization.
