    <b><font size="5">Hello!</font></b><br/>
    My name is Matt Boisgontier and I am a neuroscientist, a kinesiologist, and a physiotherapist.
    I achieved a PhD from the University of Grenoble in 2012 (France).
    Then, I did a 6-year postdoc at Leuven University (Belgium) including a 1-year visit at the University of British Columbia (Canada), both supported by the Research Foundation - Flanders (<a href="https://www.fwo.be/en/">FWO</i></a>).
    Since 2015, I have also been the University of Geneva (Switzerland).
    I do my best to support open-science practices and am a steering board member at <a href="http://sportrxiv.org">SportRÏ‡iv</i></a> and co-chair of the Society for Transparency, Openness, and Replication in Kinesiology (<a href="http://storkinesiology.org">STORK</i></a>).<br/>
