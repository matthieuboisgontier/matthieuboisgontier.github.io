    I am a neuroscientist, a kinesiologist, and a physiotherapist.<br/>
    I am passionnate about physical activity and how the brain works but am always happy to work on other topics. <br/>
    My main objectives are:<br/>
     -to do open, robust, and replicable science<br/>
     -to collaborate with clever researchers who are also good people<br/>
     -to support open-science practices
