    I am an assistant professor at the Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Ottawa and a principal investigator at the Bruyere Research Institute, Canada. Passionate about the neuroscience of physical inactivity and sensorimotor control,
    my education includes master’s degrees in Physical Therapy, Kinesiology, and Engineering at the Université Grenoble Alpes (France). 
    I earned a Ph.D. in Neuroscience at the National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS, France) with a focus on aging, 
    which was also one of the topics of my postdoctorate at KU Leuven (Belgium). 
    During this postdoc, I was fortunate to learn neuroimaging techniques such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging and advanced statistics such as mixed-effects models 
    and to establish multiple international collaborations across Europe, Canada, and USA.
