    I am a neuroscientist, a kinesiologist, and a physiotherapist.<br/>
    I am passionnate about physical activity and how the brain works but am always open to work on other topics. <br/>
    My main objectives are:<br/> -to do open, robust, and replicable science<br/> -to collaborate with clever researchers from multiple disciplines who are also good people<br/> -to support open-science practices
