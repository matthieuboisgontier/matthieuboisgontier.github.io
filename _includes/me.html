    I am passionate about the neuroscience of physical inactivity and sensorimotor control. 
    My education includes two masterâ€™s degrees in Physical Therapy and Kinesiology. 
    I finished a Ph.D. in Neuroscience in France with a focus on aging, which was also one of the topics of my postdoctorate at KU Leuven (Belgium). 
    During this postdoc, I was fortunate to learn neuroimaging techniques such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging and advanced statistics such as mixed-effects models. 
    During these last 10 years as a researcher, I have had the opportunity to establish multiple international collaborations in Canada, Europe, and USA.
