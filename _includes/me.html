    I am passionate about the neuroscience of physical inactivity and sensorimotor control. 
    My education includes master’s degrees in Physical Therapy, Kinesiology, and Engineering at the Université Grenoble Alpes (France). 
    I finished a Ph.D. in Neuroscience at the National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) in France with a focus on aging, 
    which was also one of the topics of my postdoctorate at KU Leuven (Belgium). 
    During this postdoc, I was fortunate to learn neuroimaging techniques such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging and advanced statistics such as mixed-effects models 
    and to establish multiple international collaborations in Canada, Europe, and USA.
