    I am a kinesiologist and a physical therapist. My MSc focused on the impact of muscle fatigue and sensory 
    supplementation on proprioception and postural control. During my PhD, I investigated the central mechanisms 
    underlying age-related decline in proprioception on the Techniques for Biomedical Engineering and Complexity 
    Management – Informatics, Mathematics and Applications Grenoble (TIMC – IMAG) team that is embedded in the 
    French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) and Universite Grenoble – Alpes (France). As a postdoc at KU Leuven (Belgium) 
    and UBC (Canada), I explore the brain predictors of postural instability/falls, 
    action selection, bimanual coordination, and automatic tendencies to approach and avoid stimuli 
    depicting physical activity and sedentary behaviors.
