    I am a professor at the <a href="https://health.uottawa.ca">Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Ottawa</a> and a principal investigator at the <a href="https://www.bruyere.org/en/bruyere-research-institute">Bruyere Research Institute</a>, Canada. 
    Passionate about the neuroscience of physical inactivity and sensorimotor control,
    my education includes master’s degrees in Physical Therapy, Kinesiology, and Engineering at the Université Grenoble Alpes (France). 
    I earned a PhD in Neuroscience at the National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS, France) with a focus on aging, 
    which was one of the topics of my postdoctorate at KU Leuven (Belgium).
