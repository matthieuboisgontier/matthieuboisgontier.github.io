    <b>Hello!</b><br/>
    My name is Matt Boisgontier and I am a neuroscientist, a kinesiologist, and a physiotherapist.
    I achieved a PhD from the University of Grenoble in 2012 (France).
    Then, I did a 5-year posdoc at Leuven University (Belgium) and a 1-year postdoc at the University of British Columbia (Canada), both supported by the Research Foundation - Flanders (FWO).
    I am passionnate about physical activity and how the brain works but am always happy to work on other topics. <br/>
    My main objectives are:<br/>
     -to do open, robust, and replicable science<br/>
     -to collaborate with clever researchers who are also good people<br/>
     -to support open-science practices<br/>
   </p>
